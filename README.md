# Hamming (7,4) - Python Implementation
Hamming(7,4) is a linear error-correcting code that encodes four bits of data into seven bits by adding three parity bits. It is a member of a larger family of Hamming codes.

This python implementation can be used
- Encode binary messages
- Parity check
- Error correction
- Bit flip
- Decode binary messages
- Get back original message

Hope this will be helpful to everyone.
